Function
The Category Tab Menu (Admin: Configuration->Layout Settings->Categories-Tabs Menu) displays the top categories as links in a list.
This mod adds the subcategories to those links.
It is a single level only so it will display subcategories or products depending on the category content.
Currently it will NOT list linked products (products that are not in their Master Category ID).

INSTALL/UPDATE
1. Uncompress the zip file on your computer.

2. Since responsive_classic SHOULD be unaltered from vanilla, you can test these files here first before duplicating them in your custom template.
Copy 
/includes/templates/responsive_classic/templates/tpl_modules_categories_tabs.php

If you already have an override copy of the tpl_modules_categories_tabs.php youâ€™ll need to compare and merge the differences.

3. Copy 
/includes/templates/responsive_classic/css/tpl_modules_categories_tabs.php
 Edit as required to fit with your styles.
